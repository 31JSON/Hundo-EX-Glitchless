# The Route
This is a route for the Breath of the Wild 100% EX Glitchless speedrun, based on the original "Granatus" route by Johnnyboomr and updated and worked on by the speedrun community. This route is intended to be completely glitchless.

The route prioritizes the following assumptions:
- The [standard rules](https://www.speedrun.com/botw?h=100-Extended&rules=category&x=xk9jv4gd-onv6v6m8.rqv4ko6q) for a 100% EX Speedrun as defined by the BotW Community will be followed.
- Champions' Ballad will be completed in the early game.
- Epona or a horse will be used in the early game, and then the Master Cycle Zero.
- At least two giant ancient cores will be obtained so that an ancient bow and ancient shield can be purchased.
- Most pictures will be taken.
- All ores along the route will be gathered.
- All drops from talus will be collected.
- Wepaon selection is mostly at the discretion of the runner.
